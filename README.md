# Employee Salary Data Warehouse (Oracle Star Schema Project)

This project implements a full OLTP-to-OLAP data warehouse pipeline using the classic Oracle HR schema. It includes:

- Star schema design with dimensions and a fact table
- ETL scripts for loading and transforming data
- Historical job tracking using both current and past employee records
- Compatible with Oracle Live SQL or any Oracle 19c+ instance

## 🧱 Star Schema Overview

- **Fact Table:** `employee_salary_fact`
- **Dimensions:**
  - `employee_dim`
  - `department_dim`
  - `job_dim`
  - `location_dim`
  - `time_dim`

Each dimension uses surrogate keys. The `time_dim` is populated dynamically with fiscal/calendar logic using PL/SQL.

---

## 🔄 ETL Logic

### Dimension Tables
- Data sourced from cloned HR schema tables
- Transformations include:
  - `tenure_band` calculation (employee_dim)
  - `job_category` classification (job_dim)
  - Email and phone normalization

### Fact Table
- Pulls salary data from `employees` (current) and `job_history` (historical)
- Calculates:
  - Bonus: `salary * commission_pct`
  - Total compensation: `salary + bonus`
  - Joins to all 5 dimensions via natural keys → surrogate keys

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Copy the Oracle HR schema tables into your own schema:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees AS SELECT * FROM hr.employees;
   -- Repeat for departments, jobs, job_history, etc.
   ```

2. Run `02_star_schema_ddl.sql` to create your OLAP schema.

3. Run `03_star_schema_etl.sql` to populate all dimensions.

4. Run `04_fact_table_etl.sql` to load the fact table.

## 📸 Example Queries

```sql
-- Total number of salary records (fact table)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee_salary_fact;

-- Total compensation per department
SELECT d.department_name, SUM(f.total_compensation)
FROM employee_salary_fact f
JOIN department_dim d ON f.surrogate_department_id = d.surrogate_department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name;
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- All surrogate keys are `VARCHAR2(32)` and generated via `SYS_GUID()` or `TO_CHAR(ORA_HASH(...))` where applicable.
- This project is fully compliant with the conditions set in the Telerik Data Engineering course PDF.
